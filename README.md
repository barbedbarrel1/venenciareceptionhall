## Setup (in order)

### 1. Supabase
1. Create a project at supabase.com (free tier is fine)
2. SQL Editor → New query → paste ALL of `venecia_supabase_setup.sql` → Run
3. Authentication → Users → Add user → create login(s) for the owner (and manager)
4. Storage → New bucket → name: `gallery-images` → **Public bucket: ON**
5. On that bucket, add policies allowing `authenticated` users to INSERT and DELETE
6. Settings → API → copy the **Project URL** and **anon public key**

### 2. Connect the site
Open `config.js` and paste your URL + anon key. That's the only file you edit to go live. (The anon key is safe in frontend code — Row Level Security is the real lock.)

### 3. Real photos
- Hero: save the best ballroom shot as `images/hero.jpg` (it's already wired in style.css)
- Gallery: upload photos through **the admin panel → Settings → Gallery** (they go to Supabase Storage and appear on the site instantly, categorized and filterable)
- Event cards on the homepage: replace the `<div class="ph">Photo</div>` placeholders in index.html with `<img>` tags

### 4. GitHub Pages
1. Push this folder to a repo
2. Settings → Pages → deploy from `main` branch, root folder
3. Add the custom domain (veneciareceptionhall.com) and update its DNS

### 5. Social + footer links
Search each HTML file for `href="#"` in the `.socials` block and paste their real Facebook / Instagram / TikTok URLs.

## Admin panel logic worth knowing
- **Balance** = contract price − sum of ALL payment rows. Computed by the `client_balances` view in Supabase, never stored, can't go stale.
- **Credits** (client removes something from a package): stored as NEGATIVE payment rows with a note. They reduce the balance but do NOT count as collected income.
- **Cancellations** are a status change, never a delete — kept deposits stay in collected income and history is preserved.
- **Convert to client** on an inquiry links the lead to the client record (`converted_client_id`) — this is how you later prove "the website generated $X in bookings."

## Language toggle
EN/ES button in the nav swaps every element tagged `data-i18n` using the STRINGS object in `main.js`. Choice is saved in localStorage. To change any wording, edit the STRINGS object — both languages live in one place.

## Not included (by design, phase 2 material)
- Email notification when a new inquiry arrives (Supabase Edge Function + Resend free tier — currently the owner checks the Inquiries tab, which shows a count badge)
- Analytics (add Plausible or GA4 script tag when ready)
